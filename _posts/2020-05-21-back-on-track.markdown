I started blogging before blogging had a name. I used to have a GeoCities website where I'd post the stuff that I was working on at the time, then moved that over to a proper website, then moved it over to Blogger and Wordpress. 

I have it all archived and hopefully I'll have the time to put it back up sometime.

In the meantime I'll just jot down my rambling thoughts and experiments here.
