I'm passionate about building products, optimizing processes and creating value. I like pushing software craftsmanship, agile and lean methods on high stakes, small team, fixed deadline projects.

I act as a liaison. I guide, advise and facilitate. Hopefully while doing this I add value. Some people say that I do and who am I to disagree...

When I do get around to working hands-on, I make a fairly good architect, developer, sysadmin, DBA, technical writer and sometimes presales support for large scale enterprise applications. 

I like client immersion and actually talking to end-users so I sneak out from time to time and train people or speak at conferences.

I started coding as a kid and never stopped.
